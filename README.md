LAMP Installation
===========================
Aiming to install LAMP stack and make some configuration super fast.

Compatibility
-------------

Tested on newly deployed Ubuntu 20.04 [upcloud](https://www.upcloud.com) server.

Upcloud has incredibly fast [servers](https://upcloud.com/compare/digitalocean/). Their $5 linux box is much faster than my gaming laptop!!
